************* This DSI is not ready for production *******************

This DSI is intended to allow GridFTP servers to speak directly to
Spectra Logic's BlackPearl system using their DS3 interface. This
DSI provides a POSIX-like view of the object store.

Known Issues
============
1) There is a memory bug with partial stats so partial stats are disabled.
   Partial stats allow for long (> 200 entries) directory listings. With this
   disabled, directory listings will be truncated to 200 entries.

2) Partial CKSMs are disabled. This is could likely be fixed by generating the
   checksum on the fly. This functionality is seldom used (never used by the
   Globus transfer service).

3) A 'directory' is created either because there is a zero-length object with
   '/' appended or the directory can exist because it is a prefix of an object.
   In the latter case, 'MKD <dir>' will succeed. This is low priority.
 

4) Related to (3) above, 'RMD <dir>' can succeed if the object with '/' appended
   exists regardless of if other objects have that prefix. After the RMD succeeds,
   the directory will still show in listings due to the objects with the prefix.

5) Directories that exist due to a common_prefix will disappear when the object with
   the common_prefix is removed.

6) Directory entry counts are not checked before deleting an object that represents
   a directory.

7) Inodes in directory listings are not supported.

8) UIDs in directory listings are not supported.

9) GIDs in directory listings are not supported.

10) Directory link counts in lists are not supported.

11) Listing of '/' will be truncated at STAT_ENTRIES_PER_REPLY entries.

12) Modification times are not supported in directory listings.

13) Modification times are not supported as a sync method.

14) Checksums can not be used as a sync method.

15) Checksums can not be stored; checksums must always be recomputed which may require
    a tape mount.
