************* This DSI is not ready for production *******************

This DSI is intended to allow GridFTP servers to speak directly to
Spectra Logic's BlackPearl system using their DS3 interface. This
DSI provides a POSIX-like view of the object store.

Known Issues (Ordered by severity)
==================================
1) Chunk transfers do not work. Multi-chunk staging does not work.

2) Modification times are not supported as a sync method.

3) Checksums can not be used as a sync method.

4) Checksums can not be stored; checksums must always be recomputed which may require
   a tape mount.

5) Listing of '/' will be truncated at STAT_ENTRIES_PER_REPLY entries.

6) Directory listings other than '/' do not have '.' and '..' entries.

7) A 'directory' is created either because there is a zero-length object with
   '/' appended or the directory can exist because it is a prefix of an object.
   In the latter case, 'MKD <dir>' will succeed. This is low priority.
 
8) Related to (3) above, 'RMD <dir>' can succeed if the object with '/' appended
   exists regardless of if other objects have that prefix. After the RMD succeeds,
   the directory will still show in listings due to the objects with the prefix.

9) Directories that exist due to a common_prefix will disappear when the object with
   the common_prefix is removed.

10) Directory entry counts are not checked before deleting an object that represents
    a directory.

11) Inodes in directory listings are not supported.

12) UIDs in directory listings are not supported.

13) GIDs in directory listings are not supported.

14) Directory link counts in lists are not supported.

15) Modification times are not supported in directory listings.

16) Partial CKSMs are disabled. This is could likely be fixed by generating the
    checksum on the fly. This functionality is seldom used (never used by the
    Globus transfer service).

17) You can not set permissions
